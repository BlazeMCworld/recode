## Contributing

recode is open source, and the community is welcome to add their own contributions. We only ask that you follow these guidelines:

1. Keep unrelated code additions/changes/fixes to separate pull requests, so they can be separately worked on and merged without merging unfinished code into the main branch.
2. When adding or editing Kotlin code, follow the style guide at https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html unless you have a good reason not to.

recode currently uses Kotlin version 1.7.0, so you will need to use an IDE that supports it (recommended: IntelliJ with Kotlin plugin v1.7.0).
